# Extending Action User addon of  Wordpres EventON plugin
Wordpress Plugin EventON plugin for Action User addon extending with Paypal Email and Paypal Price to sell event tickets. I have added paypal email and price instead of using Ticket cause a user who creates event can use their own paypal account or email to receive money to their account directly without having to get transfer by admin of the website.


# This code are only for Action User addon of EventON plugin.


# How to use

1. Copy these codes to your functions.php file
2. Go to your wordpress Dashboard and navigate to "myEventON" -> "Action User".
3. Go to "Form Fields" under "General" tab.
4. At the bottom of "Fields for the Event Submission form", you will see new fields as "ExtPaypal Email" and "ExtPaypal Selling Price".
5. Put a tick mark on them to enable it and Save the page. 
Voila! :)

That's all!
